## COVID19-Data-Analysis-using-Python
#### Data Analysis on Covid19 infection and death datasets, combined with a World Happines Report dataset.
#### This is a Coursera Network portfolio project I took, on which I expanded, sleightly.

#### The dataset includes dates ranging from 1/22/20 until 4/30/20.

#### The interesting outcome of the project is the observed positive correlation (although a rather weak one), between covid infection rates, death rates, and some measures of hapiness.
#### This could be further investigated, perhaps with a larger sample period, for example.
